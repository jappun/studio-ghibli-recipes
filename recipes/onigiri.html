        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p><em>This recipe was taken from Wonderland Recipes. You can find the original <a href="http://wonderlandrecipes.com/2016/08/04/chihiros-onigiri-japanese-rice-balls-from-spirited-away/">here</a></em></p>

        <p>In the Spirited Away, a little girl named Chihiro must work in a sorceress' spa for
            magical spirits while attempting to find her enchanted parents (they’ve been transformed 
            into pigs—who may soon be served for dinner to the magical guests!).</p>

        <p>When Chihiro becomes overwhelmed and despairs of ever freeing herself and her parents, 
            her friend Haku gives her a Japanese rice ball (called “onigiri”). As she eats, Chihiro calms 
            down and renews her resolve to defeat the sorceress. Though there are lots of significant foods 
            in Spirited Away, I decided to make the onigiri because I love how that tiny act of friendship 
            helped Chihiro when she needed it most.</p>

        <p>This onigiri recipe looks just a little different from the one in the film. The rice ball in the 
            movie had no traditional nori wrap and appeared to have no filling, but I wanted to make something a 
            little more special. So I decided to include a nori wrap and some grilled salmon filling. The simple 
            rice, light salmon, and salty roasted nori combine to make the perfect snack. Enjoy!  </p>
