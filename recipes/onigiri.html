        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p><em>This recipe was taken from Wonderland Recipes. You can find the original <a href="http://wonderlandrecipes.com/2016/08/04/chihiros-onigiri-japanese-rice-balls-from-spirited-away/">here</a></em></p>

        <p>In the Spirited Away, a little girl named Chihiro must work in a sorceress' spa for
            magical spirits while attempting to find her enchanted parents (they’ve been transformed 
            into pigs—who may soon be served for dinner to the magical guests!).</p>

        <p>When Chihiro becomes overwhelmed and despairs of ever freeing herself and her parents, 
            her friend Haku gives her a Japanese rice ball (called “onigiri”). As she eats, Chihiro calms 
            down and renews her resolve to defeat the sorceress. Though there are lots of significant foods 
            in Spirited Away, I decided to make the onigiri because I love how that tiny act of friendship 
            helped Chihiro when she needed it most.</p>

        <p>This onigiri recipe looks just a little different from the one in the film. The rice ball in the 
            movie had no traditional nori wrap and appeared to have no filling, but I wanted to make something a 
            little more special. So I decided to include a nori wrap and some grilled salmon filling. The simple 
            rice, light salmon, and salty roasted nori combine to make the perfect snack. Enjoy!  </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <em> Makes 12 rice balls</em>
        <ul>
            <li>6 mini sheets of roasted seaweed (also called “nori”)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup shredded cooked salmon</li>
            <li>1 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
            <li>6 cups cooked sticky rice</li>
            <li>a triangle shaped cookie cutter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Start by slicing your nori sheets in half lengthwise. My sheets were 2 ½” x 3 ½”, so in the 
                end I had 12 strips that were 1 ¼” wide. Mix the mayonnaise into your salmon until well 
                coated. Set the salmon mix and nori aside.</li>
            <li>NOTE: If you’re using freshly cooked rice, wait until the rice is cool enough to handle. 
                If using cold leftover rice, reheat it in a microwave at 30 second intervals until slightly
                 warm—not hot. I recommend only reheating and using a couple cups of rice at a time, then 
                 heating up more when you run out. This way, the rice won’t go cold before you’re finished 
                 working with it.</li>
            <li>Put the cookie cutter on a flat surface. Place an 8″x8″ sheet of plastic wrap over the cookie 
                cutter and push some of it it down inside so that the inside of the cookie cutter is completely 
                lined with plastic wrap. Scoop approximately 2 tbsp of rice into the bottom of the cutter and 
                press it flat with a plastic spoon or small rubber spatula (the rice won’t stick to the tools 
                as much as it sticks to fingers!). When flattening the rice, push it around so that it reaches 
                right up to the corners of the cutter (add more rice if needed to make sure the bottom is 
                completely coated). Place 1 tsp salmon filling into the middle of the rice, spreading it around 
                just a little, so there will be a little salmon in each bite of rice when you’re finished.</li>
            <li>Place a couple more tablespoons of rice on top and flatten out as before. Add a little extra 
                rice if you need more to cover up the salmon. Wrap the plastic tightly over the exposed end 
                of the onigiri and pop it out of the cookie cutter. Firmly wrap any loose ends around the 
                outside of the onigiri. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Repeat with remaining rice and salmon until you run out of ingredients (for me, this made 12 
                rice balls).</li>
            <li>Let the onigiri set for 5-10 minutes. If planning to eat them later, place them on a baking 
                sheet and chill until ready to serve (you can reheat them in the microwave inside the plastic 
                wrap for no more than 20-25 seconds—if they get too hot, they can fall apart).</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, remove the plastic wrap and press a nori strip around the bottom of each 
                onigiri. The rice should still be sticky enough that the nori adheres with no problems.</li>
                <li>Serve at a spa for magical creatures while brainstorming ideas to save your loved ones.</li>
