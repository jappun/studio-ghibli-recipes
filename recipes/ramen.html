    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p><em>This recipe was taken from Sylvia Wakana. You can find the original <a href="https://sylviawakana.com/ponyo-ramen/">here</a></em></p>
    
    <p>Ever watch Studio Ghibli films and wish you could eat all the delicious food? Well now you can!</p>
    
    <p>Ponyo’s Ramen is super easy because it uses instant ramen. Instant ramen is full of nostalgia and 
        is a comfort food for many people in and out of Japan, which is probably why this dish was so 
        highly requested. The simplicity of the ramen and the scene in general really takes you back to
        simple homemade instant ramen so many of us ate growing up (and probably still eat, let’s be honest).</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <em>Serves 1</em>
    <ul>
        <li>1 instant ramen noodle packet</li>
        <li>1 egg, hard of soft boiled</li>
        <li>1 green onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 piece ham, cut in half</li>
        <li>2.5 cups of water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Prep the ingredients: Hard or soft boil the egg and cut in half, slice the green 
            onions, and cut the ham in half.</li>
        <li>Boil water in a kettle or on the stove.</li>
        <li>Place ramen noodles in a bowl. If your ramen comes with a dry ramen seasoning packet, 
            open and put it in now.</li>
        <li>Pour boiling water into the bowl. Cover the bowl and let it sit according to the ramen 
            package instructions (3-5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Once cooked uncover and separate noodles using chopsticks or a fork. Mix the water, noodles, 
            and seasoning packet together well.</li>
        <li>Top with half of the egg, sliced green onion, and both pieces of cut ham.</li>
        <li>Enjoy immediately so the noodles don't get soggy!</li>

    </ol>
